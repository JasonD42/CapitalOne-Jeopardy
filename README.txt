Jason's Jeopardy Dojo

Purpose:
Built for the Capital One coding challenge on Mind Sumo.

The web app implements an API that can be used to access thousands of old jeopardy questions. You are able to refine searches by Category, Difficulty, and Airdate.
Also has a couple bonus features. The first is the button which will play the Jeopardy music and display a random question, the second is the game board that will randomly generate a whole game.

Resources/Frameworks Used:
- GitHub pages
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- And a lot of my own CSS/JavaScript!

Biggest Issues During Development:
- Bootstrap CSS competing with the GitHub Pages theme and my own CSS
- Caching all 18000+ categories into the project using a Python script
- Getting the Game Board to show up properly with randomized catergories
